# Project: 0-javascript_is_amazing.js

## Task Description

       Write a script that prints the message:
       "JavaScript is amazing"

### Requirements

Create a constant variable named `myVar` with the value `"JavaScript is        amazing"`.
Use `console.log(...)` to print the message to the console.
Do **not** use the `var` keyword.
Filename: `0-javascript_is_amazing.js`

#### Example Output

# Project: 1-multi_languages.js

## Task Description

    Write a script that prints 3 lines:

        C is fun

### Requirements

    Use console.log(...) to print each line.
    Do not use the var keyword.
    Filename: 1-multi_languages.js

#### Best Practices

    Use const instead of let or var for values that don’t change.
    Use descriptive, camelCase variable names if storing values, such as:


    const cMessage = "C is fun";
    const pythonMessage = "Python is cool";
    const jsMessage = "JavaScript is amazing";

##### Example Output

When the script is run with Node.js:$ node 1-multi_languages.js

Result:
C is fun
Python is cool
JavaScript is amazing
